              David is a rare advertising unicorn in our market, a true enthusiast. I don't think I have seen a bigger advertising enthusiast in my whole life.  David is very knowledgeable and resourceful, pulling frameworks, references and case studies from his pockets. His successes in Young Lions prove that he is a great creative strategist, but what I value the most is his contribution to the advertising community - working with the Marketing festival, connecting people, sharing knowledge, pushing other to do better work. This is what sets him apart from the rest.

              David is a young looking man with a knowledge of an old senior when it comes to marketing strategy and planning. He is an enthusiast for anything that involves charts, theories, data..you name it. A true walking library that you wish to have yourself. And he is not afraid to use this knowledge, just like a weapon, in order to create the most rational yet the most relevant strategic solutions and plans that best fit the project. </br></br>

              Always up to date, knowing what is going on in his field, knowing the latest trends in strategic thinking, as well as in the market. I bet, as a teenager, instead of music bands, he had posters of Ritson, Les Binet or Byron Sharp hanging on his walls. With David, in a compact package you get a huge strategic mind.

              David is a rare modern digital strategist. Capable of digital recommendations across the full customer journey, yet coupled with a passion for evidence based marketing principles and a thirst to understand how brands grow in the real world. Over the past 18 months I have mentored David to help him become a fully rounded strategists and marketer encouraging him to continue to learn and apply the key principles of Byron Sharp, Les Binet and Mark Ritson in every day work and make decision, recommendations based on facts, data and real world evidence.</br></br>
              I would highly recommend him to any agency or organisation that is serious about developing talent that understands the realities of marketing and how to effectively find brand and sales growth.

              I always pay special attention to people I work with who ask “why?". They are either lazy and their "why" refers to the fact that they don't want to do something, or they are smart and their "why" means they think twice before doing something and they challenge tasks because they want to do the best job. David is in the second category.</br></br>
              He is a pure talent in searching for the best solution that - and be sure about that - he can defend with data, research and arguments. He is that rare type of person that is egoless, but still willing to fight for his opinion, that is often right and insightful. He is hardworking, witty and helpful and he is frankly the prototype of an employee you want to have in your company.

              The [redacted because of NDA] brief is the best brief I've seen in forever. It explains the gap between the data and the experience most people have. And it's great kick off to talk about resentment, frustration and the need for a “clean that's seen”.
